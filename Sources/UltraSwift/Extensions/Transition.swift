public extension View {
    
    /// Applies an asymmetric transition that both moves and fades the view during insertion and removal.
    ///
    /// The transition uses a push move combined with an opacity fade:
    /// - On insertion, the view is pushed in from the specified edge while fading in.
    /// - On removal, the view is pushed out toward the opposite edge while fading out.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    /// ```swift
    /// SomeView()
    ///     .fadeInOut(from: .bottom)
    /// ```
    ///
    /// - Parameter edge: The edge from which the view should enter on insertion. The removal
    ///   will automatically use the opposite edge.
    ///
    /// - Returns: A view modified with the described transition.
    ///
