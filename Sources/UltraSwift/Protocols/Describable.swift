import SwiftUI

/// A lightweight protocol for types that can provide a human‑readable description of themselves,
///
/// Conform to `Describable` when you want to expose a concise, user‑facing explanation or
/// additional context about a value beyond its primary title or name. For example, a model might
/// conform to both `Nameable` (for a short title) and `Describable` (for longer details).
///
/// ## Example
/// ```swift
/// struct Magazine: Nameable, Describable {
///     let name = "Nintendo Power"
///     let details = "Now you're playing with power!"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Authors: [@pianometal](https://github.com/pianometal)
nonisolated public protocol Describable {
    
    /// - Returns: A human‑readable, user‑facing description or summary of the value.
    var details: String { get }
}
